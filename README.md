“Type-Aarambha” is a program that provides a platform, especially for Nepalese people.
to practice their typing skills in both English and Nepali languages. It includes a well-crafted game that not just entertains the user but also makes them proficient in both scripts.

As the name “Type-Aarambha” suggests, this program helps kickstart a person’s journey
of learning to express themselves through the keyboard.
